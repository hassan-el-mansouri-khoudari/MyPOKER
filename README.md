# MyPoker

MyPoker is an Android application that can be used to keep track of poker games between friends. 

 - The interface is straightforward where one can see his ranking over multiple instance of time intervals (Last game / Last 3 games / Last 7 games / All ).

 - One can easily add a game in a 6MAX (or less) configuration table by putting the total amount played on in the middle and the amounts each player have at the end of the game.
The application registers the game only if the amounts sum correctly to the total and no player is used twice.

 - Adding a player is done via the third widget (Name, surname and **pseudo** are required)
